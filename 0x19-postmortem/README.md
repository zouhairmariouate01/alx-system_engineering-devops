stmortem: Web Application Outage - June 5, 2024
Issue Summary
Duration:
Start: June 5, 2024, 14:30 UTC
End: June 5, 2024, 17:00 UTC
Impact:
Our web application experienced a complete outage, resulting in 100% of users being unable to access the service. Users were greeted with a 503 Service Unavailable error. Approximately 5,000 active users were impacted, resulting in significant downtime and inconvenience.
Root Cause:
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancer, leading to an infinite loop of failed requests between servers.

Timeline
14:30 UTC - Monitoring alert triggered indicating a 100% failure rate in HTTP requests.
14:35 UTC - Engineering team notified via automated alert system.
14:40 UTC - Initial investigation began; focus on potential database issues due to recent updates.
15:00 UTC - Database was ruled out as the source; investigation shifted to network and server configuration.
15:15 UTC - Network team engaged; suspected DDoS attack due to unusual traffic patterns.
15:30 UTC - Further analysis showed traffic was internal, not external; network investigation ruled out.
15:45 UTC - Focus moved to the load balancer configuration.
16:00 UTC - Discovered misconfigured Nginx load balancer causing request loops.
16:15 UTC - Incident escalated to DevOps for immediate action.
16:30 UTC - Configuration changes made to Nginx, removing the loop.
17:00 UTC - Service fully restored and monitored for stability.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The issue originated from a recent update to the Nginx load balancer configuration. The configuration inadvertently created an infinite loop where requests were being forwarded between two servers, each directing traffic back to the other. This loop caused a rapid increase in request failures, leading to the 503 errors.
The configuration change involved updating server routing rules to accommodate a new microservice. However, the routing was incorrectly set, leading to the misdirection of traffic. This oversight caused both servers to become overloaded, unable to process any real requests.
Resolution:
To resolve the issue, the incorrect routing rules in the Nginx configuration were identified and corrected. The changes were implemented to ensure that each request was correctly directed to the appropriate server without looping back. After applying the updated configuration, the Nginx service was restarted, and normal operation resumed. Post-recovery monitoring confirmed that the fix was effective, and no further request failures were observed.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Configuration Review Process: Implement a more rigorous review and testing process for changes to server configurations.
Enhanced Monitoring: Add specific monitoring for load balancer performance and configuration changes.
Training: Conduct training sessions for the engineering and DevOps teams on best practices for configuration management.
Tasks:
Create Detailed Configuration Playbooks: Develop detailed guides for making configuration changes to ensure consistency and correctness.
Patch Nginx Load Balancer: Update to the latest stable version to benefit from security and stability improvements.
Add Load Balancer Monitoring: Implement new metrics and alerts for Nginx to monitor traffic patterns and detect configuration issues.
Perform Regular Configuration Audits: Schedule monthly audits of server configurations to catch potential misconfigurations early.
Implement Automated Configuration Testing: Develop automated tests to validate configuration changes before they are applied in production.
By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and enhance the overall reliability of our web application services.
